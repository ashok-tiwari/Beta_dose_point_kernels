# Dose point kernels simulations in GATE toolkit for:
## (1) Beta-emitting radionuclides dose point kernels
Seven medically relevant beta emitters were simulated in GATE for dose point kernels generation. Six different tissue types were choosen to quantify the impact of tissue types of dose point kernels. The summmary of the work is found here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32315249/
