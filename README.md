# Dose point kernels simulations in GATE toolkit for:
## (1) Beta-emitting radionuclides dose point kernels
Seven medically relevant beta emitters were simulated in GATE for dose point kernels generation. Six different tissue types were choosen to quantify the impact of tissue types of dose point kernels. The summmary of the work is found here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32315249/

## (2) Monoenegetic electrons dose point kernels
Monoenergetic electrons of 3 - 9 MeV were simulated in various tissue types and their dose point kernels were simulated. The directroy named Monoenergetic_electrons_dose_point_kernels consisted of sample scripts to simualte the kernels.
