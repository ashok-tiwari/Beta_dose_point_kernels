## Dose point kernels simulations in GATE toolkit
The prime motivation of this work was to generate the dose point kernels to be used as an input for the patient specific dosimetry post radiopharmaceutical therapy. In patient specific dosimetry, the dose point kernels are convolved with patient specific activity map obtained from quantitative imaging for absorebd dose calculations.

### (1) Beta-emitting radionuclides dose point kernels
Seven medically relevant beta emitters were simulated in GATE for dose point kernels generation. Six different tissue types were choosen to quantify the impact of tissue types of dose point kernels.


### (2) Monoenegetic electrons dose point kernels
Monoenergetic electrons of 3 - 9 MeV were simulated in various tissue types and their dose point kernels were simulated. The directroy named Dose_point_kernels_of_monoenergetic_electrons consisted of sample scripts to simualte the kernels.
